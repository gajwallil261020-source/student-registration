# Student Registration & Contact Intelligence System

**Course:** BCA Semester 1 — Python Programming.**Section:** C

## Project overview
This beginner-friendly Python project reads student contacts from `contacts.csv`, checks names, Indian mobile numbers and email addresses, rejects invalid or duplicate entries, lets a user view/search/add students, and prints a simple business-intelligence report.

## Files
- `main.py` — menu and main program
- `validator.py` — validates name, phone and email
- `loader.py` — reads CSV, rejects bad/duplicate records, saves clean records
- `analytics.py` — prints data-quality, phone-prefix and email-domain summaries
- `contacts.csv` — sample input records
- `students_clean.csv` — generated automatically when the program runs
- `proof/` — place your own screenshots of the program running here

## How to run
1. Install Python 3 if it is not already installed.
2. Keep all `.py` files and `contacts.csv` in the same folder.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in this folder.
4. Run: `python main.py`
5. Select menu options 1 to 6.

On some computers, use `python3 main.py` instead.

## What to test
- View all valid students (option 1)
- Search for a student by name or phone (option 2)
- Add a valid student and then check `clean_contacts.csv` (option 3)
- Print the business-intelligence report (option 4)
- View rejected rows and their reasons (option 5)
- Exit (option 6)

## Concepts used
Variables, strings, lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, conditional statements, regular expressions, CSV file handling, and `Counter` for simple summaries.
